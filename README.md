# 📅 Day 55 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔺 Problem: Count the Number of Possible Triangles
### 🧠 Difficulty: Medium
### 📌 Tags: #Day55 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Solved with 100% Accuracy ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given an array of positive integers representing lengths, determine the number of triplets (i, j, k) that form valid triangles, i.e., satisfy the triangle inequality:
- arr[i] + arr[j] > arr[k]

## 🔍 Optimized Strategy: Two-Pointer after Sorting
### 💡 Key Idea:
- Sort the array.

- Fix the largest side as arr[i] (from right to left).

- Use two pointers to count valid (left, right) combinations that satisfy the inequality.

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n²) – Reduced from O(n³) brute force

- Space Complexity: O(1) – In-place operations

## 📊 Submission Summary:
- ✅ Test Cases Passed: 1110 / 1110
